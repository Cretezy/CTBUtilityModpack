A client utility pack using Fabric, supporting Minecraft snapshot versions.

It is a light modpack providing a few mods which improve gameplay but does not change it. 

It is usually updated very quickly (1-3 days after snapshot is released), and it should be compatible with all servers.

Mods included:

- [Mouse Wheelie](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mouse-wheelie): Inventory utilities and sorting (middle-click)
- [Apple Skin](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/appleskin): Shows saturation and preview hunger
- [Light Overlay](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/light-overlay): Press F7 to see light overlay
- [Mini HUD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mini-hud): Open config using H + C, and use H to toggle HUD
- [Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items): View item recipes
- [Tweakeroo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tweakeroo): Various utility tweaks

Also includes the [Faithful resource pack](https://faithful.team).
